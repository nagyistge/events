# HospitalRun #vents
_This repository is where we plan and document hack events._

HospitalRun events are typically hack events where we invite contributors to get together and work on HospitalRun. For more information check out http://hospitalrun.io/events/.

## If you'd like to host an event

If you are interested in hosting a HospitalRun hackathon, please open an new issue to propose it. There are some resources in this repo to help you, and a member of the HospitalRun maintainers team will work with you to help coordinate it.

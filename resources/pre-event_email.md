## Template for sending out pre-event emails to attendees

Hello!

Here's a friendly reminder that you're registered to attend the HopsitalRun hackathon on [DATES]! 

We have a few extra tickets to share, so please feel free to invite your friends to join us.

**A few points of note** before you get here:
- don't forget your laptop, as most of our work will be hands-on hacking
- the venue is wheelchair accessible, and [there are gender-neutral bathrooms available]
- most of our work will be with Ember.js, so if you're not familiar, there are some great [Getting Started Guides on the Ember.js site](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.11.0/). We encourage you to take a look before you get to the event, so you can hit the ground running!
- [INCLUDE ANYTHING SPECIAL ABOUT PARKING, GETTING INTO THE BUILDING, ETC]


**What can you expect?**

Friday, we will be giving an overview of Ember, as well as the goals of HospitalRun. We will then start working on issues with the `help-wanted` label. We'll end the day with dinner, and should be finished around 7:00 pm.

Saturday, we'll jump in and continue working where we left off on Friday. We'll keep going until dinner, then we'll close it out with a grand send off on Saturday evening.
 

**Details:**

When: [DATES, TIMES]

If you have any questions before the event, please let us know!

Sincerely,

The HospitalRun Team

### Requirements for Ordering Catering

Hackathons usually span 2 days. We provide lunch and dinner both days, which means 4 meals in total. 

*Important: make sure to collect any information around dietary restrictions before the event, so you can plan accordingly. No one should go hungry at our event!*

Meal ideas:
- [ ] Pizza (order 2 slices per person, order 1-2 gluten, vegan, lactose-free)
- [ ] Tacos (usually a taco bar is better, you can order per person and allow for gluten free and vegan options)
- [ ] Deli platters (make sure to have gluten free bread and something for vegetarians/vegans besides salad)
- [ ] Local favorites (make sure to poke around for something that highlights the awesome food of the area)

Snack ideas:
- [ ] Chips (individual sized bags allow for more variety and are more sanitary)
- [ ] Veggie trays (if you have a lot of vegetarians, this is nice to offer)
- [ ] Cookies/Cupcakes (people love sugar, order 1 1/2 cupcakes per person, or 2-3 cookies per person, and don't forget GF and vegan options)

Beverages:
- [ ] Sodas (order for 3-4 cans per person, per day, go heavier on the diet soda, and make sure to have a variety)
- [ ] Water (if no water on site, order 3-4 bottles per person, per day)

           
### Other Considerations:

- [ ] If food is to be picked up, make sure the person picking up knows how far away the venue is, and give them enough time for travel
- [ ] Make sure we can change the order at the last minute. We get lots of changes the day of the event.
- [ ] Make sure to get any dietary requirements from any HospitalRun volunteers who haven't registered & count them in the final numbers

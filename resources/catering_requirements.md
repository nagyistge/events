### Requirements for Ordering Catering

- [ ] Pizza (order 2 slices per person, order 1-2 gluten, vegan, lactose-free. Check Registration for any other dietary restrictions)
- [ ] Soda (order for 1-2 cans per person, go heavier on the diet soda)
- [ ] Water (if no water on site, order 1-2 bottles per person)
- [ ] Cupcakes (order 1 1/2 per person, 6 gluten-free, 6 vegan) or Cookies (order 1 1/2 per person).
           
### Other Considerations:

- [ ] If food is to be picked up, make sure the person picking up knows how far away the venue is, and give them enough time for travel
- [ ] Local favorites may be better than pizza. (Also, may want to try taco bar or deli sandwiches).
- [ ] Make sure we can change the order at the last minute. We get lots of changes the day of the event.
- [ ] Make sure to get any dietary requirements from HospitalRun volunteers who haven't registered & count them in the final numbers
